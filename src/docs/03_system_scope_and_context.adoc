== System Scope and Context

Our main objetive is to build a descentralized web, nowadays, descentralization has a lot of limitations that hinder the construction of the system, but it also has positive aspects, like the security and privacity of our personal data.

To achive this main objetive we are using SOLID's PODS, so our web has to be capable of conecting to SOLID, in this SOLID's PODS we are going to save all data that we want to share in our web, like our tracks.

Viade will ask user own pod to retrieve user's tracks and never will save that tracks on the other users' POD.

Viade will have some different interfaces: 
****
. Login page: where user must enter his SOLID credentials. +
. Main page: shows the Viade's main page.

=== Technical Context

****

ViaDe is a web based application which relies on the foundation of decentralization. For this to be reached, all data is stored in the users' SOLID PODs. This will be integrated through the use of React JS, which will be the library of JavaScript used to build all the user interfaces of the application. An important key in the interaction and manageability of the web when communicating with the users will be the maps, which will be offered making use of OpenStreetMap API (Leaflet). Users will send their tracks through the application using SOLID POD URLs, meaning it must be connected to the internet.
