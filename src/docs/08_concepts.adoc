== Cross-cutting Concepts

=== Security 
All the components are wrapped up in a LoggedIn label that makes sure the different sites of the application can not be accessed if you have not registered before.
All the user information is stored in the pod, so that only the own user has access to it.

=== Patterns
We have use a MVC structure, separatting the application into services (they have the functionality of the application), and components (that mix the View part with the Mdel one).
We have wanted to use this architectural pattern in order to be able to distinguish the appearance, the business (logic) and the persistance.

=== Stability and Change 
As we have said in the previus point we are using a MVC structure that also allows and makes easier to make changes or increase the functionality
