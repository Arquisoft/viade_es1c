== Design Decisions


****

The list of decisions will increase throughout the development of the project. This section is highly related to section 4 (solution strategy)
The design decisions made so far are:

.Design Architecture
We base our implementation on MVC, an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller.

.Framework
React web framework: JavaScript library used to build user interfaces. Therefore the language used is JavaScript.

.Development Environment
Visual Studio Code and WebStorm.

.Version Control
We are using GIT as a distributed version-control.

.Documentation 
We are developing the documentation in arc42.

.Data Storage
The data is saved in PODs (personal online data stores) following the Solid specification.

.Pattern
TO DO: it has not been decided yet.
