|*Date* |*Decision* |*Details* |*Advantages* |*Disadvantages* |*Participants*

|11/02/2020 | *Design Architecture*  |We base our implementation on MVC, an architectural pattern that separates an application into three main logical components: the model, the view, and the controller. |Improves usability  |Need to have an organized code |All the development team

|11/02/2020 | *Development Environment* |Visual Studio Code and WebStorm. |Simplicity | |All the development team

|11/02/2020 | *Maps* |We use JavaScript library leaflet to visualize the map | Simplicity | Could be difficult to test | All the development team

|11/02/2020 |*Parse routes* |The formats must be supporteed by WikiLoc, for example, XML. |Interoperability |Variety of formats | All the team

|11/02/2020 |*Login* |The login redirects to a Solid popup in order to connect with the customers' PODs |Improves usability | If solid is not working you can not log into the application |All the development team

|11/02/2020 |*Testing* |Implementation of exhaustive Test-driven development (TDD) at the backend and frontend level. The route management system must pass successfully all the tests |Assure that the app works correctly |Need to invert time on exhaustive tests |All the development team

|04/02/2020 |*Language* |The documentation is in English, and the hole application is interationalized into English too |Internationalization |Need to translate |All the development team

|17/03/2020 |*Acceptance tests* |Implementation of Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) tests using Cucumber.
|They can be run in front of the client |Time to make them and write the 'User Stories' |All the development team

|17/03/2020 |*Routes format* |JSON-LD is the format chosen to store routes in the POD
|Following ViaDe specification | May noy be used by all groups |All the development team

|17/03/2020 |*ViaDe Specification* |Development following the ViaDe Specification
|Interoperability |May not be used by all groups |All the development team

|17/03/2020 |*Structure* |Decoupled application, separating components and functionalities.
|Improves architecture | |All the development team

|23/04/2020| *Groups* | The implementation of the groups was done following the proposal made in the following issue. https://github.com/Arquisoft/viadeSpec/issues/38
 It is developed into a Jsonld file containing the webid of the friends and group name| Flexible and allowing modifications| May not be used by all groups | Miguel and Alberto

|30/04/2020 |*Abstract Service* | All the common methods in the services are extracted into an Abstract Service
