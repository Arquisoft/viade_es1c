== Building Block View

In this section we are going to dissect the structure of our application, from the most general to the most detailed.





=== Level 1

At first, we have a diagram pretty similar to the one exposed at the third point of this documentation.
It's basically a white box. A human user interacts with the interface of the application, this interface asks to the services
the information required from the Solid Pod of the current user. As you can see, the services in this diagram are a black box,
which will be explained in detail in the next diagram.

|===
| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Services | Provides the React components of the interface the information (stored in the user's pod) required to perform the actions with the routes
|===






=== Level 2

In this level, we are going to explain in detail the Service black box presented in the previous diagram. The box splits in 7 different services. There's an inheritance relation between Abstract Service and the rest of them. This one, provides the common functionality that is required in the rest of the services. Each concrete one, correspons to a specific feature offered to the user in the interface.
