== Introduction and Goals

****
The goal of this project is to create ViaDe. ViaDe is a decentralized route management system based on SOLID specifications and created using the React framework. 
****

=== Requirements Overview

****
* Decentralized route management. 
* Users can store the routes on their own pods. 
* Users are able to view the routes on a map. 
* Users are allowed to share photos, videos or other files with their friends. 
* Notifications can be enabled to notify when a friend wants to share a route. 
* Users may have groups of friends with whom they may want to share a route. 
* Interoperability with other route management systems: it should be possible to see the routes loaded by users who are using a different app. 

.Optional features
* The system could work on a mobile device. 
* Users could share their routes in real time as they are doing the routes.
