*Although it's a basic scenario, it's one of the most important scenarios due to, if a user is not logged in, he could not use the app.*

. User opens the app at any browser. And there are two possibilities:
.. User is already logged in, so he can use de app.
.. User is not logged in, he can just click on Login and a popup will appear.
... If user has a solid account, he can select which provider does he want to use to log in and fill the login form, introducing his solid credentials.
... If user has not a solid account, he can register and create a personal POD. Then he will be able to log in introducing the entered information in the register form.
.. User will be redirected to the main UI, where he can see some of his data and a slight introduction to our app.
