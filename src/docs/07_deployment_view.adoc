== Deployment View

As it is a decentralized app, we are basically focused on the interaction between the user and the Solid platform. Users interact with the platform by the POD and every user has a unique one where itâ€™s data is stored. So, a user that is using ViaDe, is interacting with Solid and this is taking the data from the corresponding PODs in order to make the app work in an efficient way.
