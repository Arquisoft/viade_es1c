== Architecture Constraints


We will divide the restrictions into:

. Technical constraints
. Organizational and political constraints
. Conventions constraints



=== Technical constraints

Constraints that have to do with design and implementation decisions

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Decentralized system, where data storage will be separated from the application
|For this we will use the Solid PODs. Where customer data will be saved
|Data persistence. Where to save customer data: routes, friends, images, videos, route information
|For this we will also use the Solid PODs
|Using the React framework
|We will use the React JavaScript library for the development of user interfaces. This development environment merges, links the structure of the interface with the logic.
|Interoperability between different route management systems
|The application must be compatible with other route management systems.
|Follow the specification proposed in the  GitHub's ViadeSpec repository| Try to follow the specifications of the GitHub ViadeSpec repository, to make the application more interoperable. We have followed these specifications until version 1.1.
| Solid Specifications |Follow Solid specifications

=== Organizational and political constraints
Constraints that have to do with team organization.

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Team
|It will work with a team of 6 people
| Time
| Comply with the proposed deadline
|Developing
|The project can be deployed from the repository with Travis. Codecov (https://codecov.io/) is also used for code coverage and codacy for code quality.
|===

=== Conventions constraints
Restrictions that have to do with the conventions that the team will agree, for example, programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions

|===
|Constraint |Explanation

|Documentation
|The documentation will be done using Ascii-Doctor, Ruby, Node and following the Arc42 structure
|Version control
|Version control will be performed using GitHub

****
.Contents
Any requirement that constrains software architects in their freedom of design and implementation decisions or decision about the development process. These constraints sometimes go beyond individual systems and are valid for whole organizations and companies.

.Motivation
Architects should know exactly where they are free in their design decisions and where they must adhere to constraints.
Constraints must always be dealt with; they may be negotiable, though.

.Form
Simple tables of constraints with explanations.
If needed you can subdivide them into
technical constraints, organizational and political constraints and
conventions (e.g. programming or versioning guidelines, documentation or naming conventions)
